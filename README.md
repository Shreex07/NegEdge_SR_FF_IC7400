# Negative Edge Triggered SR Flip-Flop using IC 7400

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **negative edge–triggered SR flip-flop** using **IC 7400 (Quad 2-input NAND gates)**.
The design was first verified through simulation using **Tinkercad** before physical implementation.

## 🧠 Concept
- Uses NAND-based SR latch
- Triggered on the **falling edge of the clock**
- Demonstrates basic sequential logic using TTL ICs

## 🛠 Components Used
- IC 7400 (Quad NAND Gate)
- Clock source
- Logic inputs (S, R)
- Power supply (Vcc = 5V)

## 💻 Simulation
- The circuit was simulated using **Tinkercad**
- Simulation link is provided.

**Note:** Hardware implementation images/videos could not be uploaded at this time due to unavailability. They will be added in a future update.
